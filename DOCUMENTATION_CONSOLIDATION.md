## 🚀 Going Forward

### When Adding New Features
1. Update `PROJECT_STATUS_&_ROADMAP.md` with feature status
2. Add endpoints to `API_ENDPOINTS.md`
3. Update relevant section in primary docs
4. Create specific guide if complex

### When Starting New Phase
1. Update `PROJECT_STATUS_&_ROADMAP.md` with new phase details
2. Create Phase-specific guide if needed (e.g., `PHASE3_PARENT_DASHBOARD.md`)
3. Link from `README.md`
4. Archive old phase docs

### Documentation Review
- Keep 5 primary docs always current
- Archive phase docs after completion
- Review and consolidate quarterly
- Remove redundant information immediately
